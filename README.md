# crud
a simple project to create delete and update in a database using node.js backend server

Here I will be reffereing the new entry as "ALIEN" . The name of the database in the  localhost server in my machine is AlienDBex.  An Alien is a new student which is to be added . I have given the schema of the database in the file named models.js . It stores the name of the alien (New entry ) , the technology on which the alien is working and the degree he will earn . These three values will be added to the database and a unique id for each alien will be generated.
